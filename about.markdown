Welcome! This is my non-professional blog. I use this space for public
note-taking and writing practice. Expect poetry, blog posts about reasoning,
thoughts about music-making, summaries of what I've been thinkinag about
recently, half-cocked original philosophy, nature photos, and maybe some doodles
if I'm feeling scribbly.

If you'd like to reach out, I'm active on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndrewBroz). Friendly interactions welcome,
including thoughtful criticism.

_Andrew Bro≈æ is a software engineer and sometimes cellist from Texas, now living
in San Francisco. He finds joy in unexpected chord changes, poetic turns, and
mathematical insights (among other things). He speaks Russian and Ukrainian in
addition to his native English._
