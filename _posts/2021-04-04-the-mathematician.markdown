Your problem’s unconventional,<br />
and seems multidimensional,<br />
but closely viewed, it is, in fact,<br />
a tempest in a tesseract.<br />
A substitution should be tried;<br />
it’s just a cube when simplified.<br />
Once it’s a cube you’re halfway there:<br />
project your problem to a square,<br />
and then your problem, rendered flat,<br />
can probably be left at that.<br />
Not satisfied? You could consign<br />
your problem to a finite line,<br />
reduce it to a single point,<br />
then prove its membership disjoint<br />
from all the sets belonging to<br />
the set of things that trouble you.<br />
Therefore, as you can plainly see,<br />
there is no problem. _Q.E.D._<br />

My husband, as he often does,<br />
finds fault in all these algebras.<br />
“Don’t confuse,” he says to me,<br />
“the model with reality.”<br />
But problems, being what they are —<br />
of science, or of some crossed star —<br />
just never seem to be designed<br />
to fit a mathematician’s mind.<br />
